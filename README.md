## Lesson 1: Variables
**Description:**  
Learn how to declare, initialize, and use variables in C++. Variables store data that your program manipulates.

**Code Preview:**

#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int x = 5;
    std::cout << x << std::endl;
}
```

## Lesson 2: Data Types
**Description:**  
Understand the different data types in C++ such as int, float, char, and bool. Each is used to store a specific kind of value.

**Code Preview:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    float pi = 3.14;
    char grade = 'A';
}
```

## Lesson 3: Control Flow
**Description:**  
Explore how to control the flow of your program using if-else statements and loops.

**Code Preview:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int score = 85;
    if (score > 80) {
        std::cout << "Good job!";
    }
}
```
